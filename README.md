This is a collection of my more polished 5th-edition homebrew.
The PDFs are fairly self-contained and only reference officially published material as a basis, so feel free to take what you like.

I'll keep a brief list and description of each item here:

Alchemist Class.pdf - A pseudo-martial class that uses rules from Xanathar's Guide to Everything, along with an item-production class feature to make potion production viable in nearly every campaign, and have alchemy be the key identity feature of the class. Relies exclusively on alchemy as a source of power, creating a non-spellcasting alternative to the Artificer's Alchemist subclass that interacts with normal potions and poisons in general along with some new unique alchemy items as class features.

Invoker Class.pdf - A wisdom pact-caster that acts closer to a full-caster rather than a half-caster or hybrid character. Essentially an unhinged mix of warlock, sorcerer, and cleric. Mostly a thought experiment to practice using pact-casting and custom spells in homebrew, as well as a partial exploration of some unique Forgotten Realms lore (see Elven High Magic).

Shaman Class.pdf - A Warcraft-inspired, totem-building Shaman. A Half-Caster who can specialize to become more martial or to gain access to more powerful spellcasting, creating a sort of "3/4"-Caster. An old brew and the first I ever wrote, something born from a love I bear for the Warcraft and DotA universes.

Sorcerer: Destined Weapon.pdf - A melee weapon-focused subclass for sorcerers. Driving identity is the legendary status of certain warrior-weapon combinations, such as King Arthur and Excalibur, or Thor and Mj√∂lnir.
